ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kayla!
\
I study the intersection of mental health and public health, and Iâ€™m currently completing a master's of public health at the University of Toronto, while working at the SickKids Research Institute.
\
Iâ€™m always interested in collaborating on research related to mental health, increased access to care, substance use trends, and care for children with special health care needs. You can reach me by e-mail at kayla.esser@mail.utoronto.ca
