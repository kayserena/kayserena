Hi, Iâ€™m Kayla!
\
I work in the intersection of mental health and public health, and I recently completed a Masters of Public Health in epidemiology at the University of Toronto, while working at the SickKids Research Institute.
\
Iâ€™m always interested in collaborating on research related to mental health, social determinants of health, increased access to care, substance use trends, and care for children with special health care needs and their families. You can reach me by e-mail at kayla.esser@mail.utoronto.ca ðŸ˜Š
